          <br />

          <p>
            These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made
            between You, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("You")
            and Gowon ("Gowon", "We", "Us", or "Our"), concerning Your access to
            and use of Gowon as well as any other media form, website, media
            channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or
            otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the "Bot").
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            By accessing or using the Bot, You signify that You have read,
            understand and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (these "Terms
            of Use" or this "Agreement"). You are only authorized to use the Bot
            (regardless of whether Your access or use is intended) if You agree
            to abide by all applicable laws and to this Agreement.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            We reserve the right, at Our sole discretion, to change, modify,
            add, or delete portions of these Terms of Service at any time
            without further notice. If We do this, We will post the changes to
            these Terms & Conditions on the Discord support server. Your
            continued use of the Bot after any such changes constitutes Your
            acceptance of the revised Terms & Conditions. If You do not comply
            with this Agreement at any time, We reserve the right to cancel or
            terminate Your access to the Bot (or any part thereof) and/or Your
            user account, if any.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            In Gowon's sole discretion and without prior notice or liability, We
            may discontinue, modify or alter any aspect of the Bot including,
            but not limited to, (i) restricting the time the Bot is available,
            (ii) restricting the amount of use permitted, and (iii) restricting
            or terminating any user's right to use the Bot. You agree that any
            termination or cancellation of Your access to, or use of, the Bot
            may be effected without prior notice. If You do not abide by the
            terms of this Agreement, You agree that We may immediately
            deactivate or delete Your user account, if any, and all related
            information and/or files in Your user account and/or bar any further
            access to such information and/or files and/or the Bot (or part
            thereof). Further, You agree that We shall not be liable to You or
            any third-party for any termination or cancellation of Your access
            to, or use of, the Bot.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            You acknowledge that Your only right with respect to any
            dissatisfaction with any modification or discontinuation of or to
            the Bot, or any policies or practices by Gowon in providing the Bot,
            including without limitation any change in content, is to cease
            using the Bot and cancel or terminate Your registered user account,
            as applicable. Although Gowon does not constantly monitor the Bot,
            it nevertheless expressly reserves the right to do so.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            From time to time, We may supplement this Agreement with additional
            terms and conditions pertaining to specific content, activities or
            events ("Additional Terms"). Such Additional Terms may be placed on
            the Bot to be viewed in connection with the specific content,
            activities, features or events and shall be identified as such. You
            understand and agree that such Additional Terms are hereby
            incorporated by reference into this Agreement.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>

            applicable therein. You also agree and hereby submit to the
            non-exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the
            Province of British Columbia and acknowledge that You do so
            voluntarily and are responsible for complying with all local laws.

          <p>
            These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by Us
            on the website or in respect to the Bot constitute the entire
            agreement and understanding between You and Us. Our failure to
            exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use
            shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law.
            We may assign any or all of Our rights and obligations to others at
            any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss,
            damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond Our
            reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of these
            Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable,
            that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from
            these Terms of Use and does not affect the validity and
            enforceability of any remaining provisions.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency
            relationship created between You and Us as a result of these Terms
            of Use or use of the Bot. You agree that these Terms of Use will not
            be construed against Us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby
            waive any and all defenses You may have based on the electronic form
            of these Terms of Use and the lack of signing by the parties hereto
            to execute these Terms of Use.
